# CSPC-456 Network Security Fundamentals

## Assignment 1

### Purpose: 

If you are an attacker who has worked your way into the deepest depths of an 
enterprise target, you may find yourself in a bit of a conundrum: you have no tools to 
execute network attacks. No netcat. No Wireshark. No compiler and no means to install 
one. However, you might be surprised to find that in many cases, youâ€™ll find a Python 
install, and so that is where we will begin.

This exercise is designed to get you comfortable with the basics of creating simple 
client/server network tools when you don't have the luxury to install well known ones.

Complete this assignment by replacing the `REPLACE_ME` items with a valid value. 
Run the programs, screenshot the output, add to a document and upload it to Canvas.
